> A list of funny and tricky JavaScript examples

JavaScript is a great language. It has a simple syntax, large ecosystem and, what is most important, a great community.

At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with tricky parts. Some of them can quickly turn our everyday job into hell, some of them can make us laugh out loud.

The original idea for WTFJS belongs to [Brian Leroux](https://twitter.com/brianleroux). This list is highly inspired by his talk [**“WTFJS”** at dotJS 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et8xNAc2ic8):

# 💪🏻 Motivation

> Just for fun
>
> &mdash; _[**“Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary”**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_for_Fun), Linus Torvalds_

The primary goal of this list is to collect some crazy examples and explain how they work, if possible. Just because it's fun to learn something that we didn't know before.

If you are a beginner, you can use these notes to get a deeper dive into JavaScript. I hope these notes will motivate you to spend more time reading the specification.

If you are a professional developer, you can consider these examples as a great reference for all of the quirks and unexpected edges of our beloved JavaScript.

In any case, just read this. You're probably going to find something new.

# ✍🏻 Notation

**`// ->`** is used to show the result of an expression. For example:

```js
1 + 1 // -> 2
```

**`// >`** means the result of `console.log` or another output. For example:

```js
console.log('hello, world!') // > hello, world!
```

**`//`** is just a comment used for explanations. Example:

```js
// Assigning a function to foo constant
const foo = function () {}
```

# 👀 Examples

## `[]` is equal `![]`

Array is equal not array:

```js
[] == ![] // -> true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

* [**12.5.9** Logical NOT Operator (`!`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-logical-not-operator)
* [**7.2.13** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## true is false

```js
!!'false' ==  !!'true'  // -> true
!!'false' === !!'true' // -> true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Consider this step-by-step:

```js
true == 'true'    // -> true
false == 'false'  // -> false

// 'false' is not empty string, so it's truthy value
!!'false' // -> true
!!'true'  // -> true
```

* [**7.2.13** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## baNaNa

```js
'b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a'
```

This is an old-school joke in JavaScript, but remastered. Here's the original one:

```js
'foo' + + 'bar' // -> 'fooNaN'
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The expression is evaluated as `'foo' + (+'bar')`, which converts `'bar'` to not a number.

* [**12.8.3** The Addition Operator (`+`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-addition-operator-plus)

## `NaN` is not a `NaN`

```js
NaN === NaN // -> false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The specification strictly defines the logic behind this behavior:

> 1. If `Type(x)` is different from `Type(y)`, return **false**.
> 2. If `Type(x)` is Number, then
>     1. If `x` is **NaN**, return **false**.
>     2. If `y` is **NaN**, return **false**.
>     3. … … …
>
> &mdash; [**7.2.14** Strict Equality Comparison](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-strict-equality-comparison)

Following the definition of `NaN` from the IEEE:

> Four mutually exclusive relations are possible: less than, equal, greater than, and unordered. The last case arises when at least one operand is NaN. Every NaN shall compare unordered with everything, including itself.
>
> &mdash; [“What is the rationale for all comparisons returning false for IEEE754 NaN values?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1565164/1573715#1573715) at StackOverflow

## It's a fail

You would not believe, but …

```js
(![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]
// -> 'fail'
```

### 💡 Explanation:

By breaking that mass of symbols into pieces, we notice that the following pattern occurs often:

```js
(![]+[]) // -> 'false'
![]      // -> false
```

So we try adding `[]` to `false`. But due to a number of internal function calls (`binary + Operator` -> `ToPrimitive` -> `[[DefaultValue]]`) we end up converting the right operand to a string:

```js
(![]+[].toString()) // 'false'
```

Thinking of a string as an array we can access its first character via `[0]`:

```js
'false'[0] // -> 'f'
```

The rest is obvious, but the `i` is tricky. The `i` in `fail` is grabbed by generating the string `'falseundefined'` and grabbing the element on index `['10']`

## `[]` is truthy, but not `true`

An array is a truthy value, however, it's not equal to `true`.

```js
!![]       // -> true
[] == true // -> false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Here are links to the corresponding sections in the ECMA-262 specification:

* [**12.5.9** Logical NOT Operator (`!`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-logical-not-operator)
* [**7.2.13** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## `null` is falsy, but not `false`

Despite the fact that `null` is a falsy value, it's not equal to `false`.

```js
!!null        // -> false
null == false // -> false
```

At the same time, other falsy values, like `0` or `''` are equal to `false`.

```js
0 == false  // -> true
'' == false // -> true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The explanation is the same as for previous example. Here's the corresponding link:

* [**7.2.13** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-abstract-equality-comparison)

## Minimal value is greater than zero

`Number.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest number, which is greater than zero:

```js
Number.MIN_VALUE > 0 // -> true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

> `Number.MIN_VALUE` is `5e-324`, i.e. the smallest positive number that can be represented within float precision, i.e. that's as close as you can get to zero. It defines the best resolution that floats can give you.
>
> Now the overall smallest value is `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` although it's not really numeric in a strict sense.
>
> &mdash; [“Why is `0` less than `Number.MIN_VALUE` in JavaScript?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26614728/why-is-0-less-than-number-min-value-in-javascript) at StackOverflow

* [**20.1.2.9** Number.MIN_VALUE](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-well-known-symbols)

## function is not function

> ⚠️ A bug present in V8 v5.5 or lower (Node.js <=7) ⚠️

All of you know about the annoying _undefined is not a function_, but what about this?

```js
// Declare a class which extends null
class Foo extends null {}
// -> [Function: Foo]

new Foo instanceof null
// > TypeError: function is not a function
// >     at … … …
```

### 💡 Explanation:

This is not a part of the specification. It's just a bug that has now been fixed, so there shouldn't be a problem with it in the future.

## Adding arrays

What if you try to add two arrays?

```js
[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]  // -> '1,2,34,5,6'
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The concatenation happens. Step-by-step, it looks like this:

```js
[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]
// call toString()
[1, 2, 3].toString() + [4, 5, 6].toString()
// concatenation
'1,2,3' + '4,5,6'
// ->
'1,2,34,5,6'
```

## Trailing commas in array

You've created an array with 4 empty elements. Despite all, you'll get an arrary with three elements, because of trailing comas:

```js
let a = [,,,]
a.length     // -> 3
a.toString() // -> ',,'
```

### 💡 Explanation:

> **Trailing commas** (sometimes called "final commas") can be useful when adding new elements, parameters, or properties to JavaScript code. If you want to add a new property, you can simply add a new line without modifying the previously last line if that line already uses a trailing comma. This makes version-control diffs cleaner and editing code might be less troublesome.

## Array equality is a monster

Array equality is a monster in JS, think below:

```js
[] == ''   // -> true
[] == 0    // -> true
[''] == '' // -> true
[0] == 0   // -> true
[0] == ''  // -> false
[''] == 0  // -> true

[null] == ''      // true
[null] == 0       // true
[undefined] == '' // true
[undefined] == 0  // true

[[]] == 0  // true
[[]] == '' // true

[[[[[[]]]]]] == '' // true
[[[[[[]]]]]] == 0  // true

[[[[[[ null ]]]]]] == 0  // true
[[[[[[ null ]]]]]] == '' // true

[[[[[[ undefined ]]]]]] == 0  // true
[[[[[[ undefined ]]]]]] == '' // true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

You should be very careful for above! This is a complex examples, but it's described in  [**7.2.13** Abstract Equality Comparison](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-abstract-equality-comparison) section of the specification.

## `undefined` and `Number`

If we don't pass any arguments into the `Number` constructor, we'll get `0`. The value `undefined` is assigned to formal arguments when there are no actual arguments, so you might expect that `Number` without arguments takes `undefined` as a value of its parameter. However, when we pass `undefined`, we will get `NaN`.

```js
Number()          // -> 0
Number(undefined) // -> NaN
```

### 💡 Explanation:

According to the specification:

1. If no arguments were passed to this function's invocation, let `n` be `+0`.
2. Else, let `n` be ? `ToNumber(value)`.
3. In case of `undefined`, `ToNumber(undefined)` should return `NaN`.

Here's the corresponding section:

* [**20.1.1** The Number Constructor](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-number-constructor)
* [**7.1.3** ToNumber(`argument`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-tonumber)

## `parseInt` is a bad guy

`parseInt` is famous by its quirks:

```js
parseInt('f*ck');     // -> NaN
parseInt('f*ck', 16); // -> 15
```

**💡 Explanation:** This happens because `parseInt` will continue parsing character-by-character until it hits a character it doesn't know. The `f` in `'f*ck'` is the hexadecimal digit `15`.

Parsing `Infinity` to integer is something…

```js
//
parseInt('Infinity', 10) // -> NaN
// ...
parseInt('Infinity', 18) // -> NaN...
parseInt('Infinity', 19) // -> 18
// ...
parseInt('Infinity', 23) // -> 18...
parseInt('Infinity', 24) // -> 151176378
// ...
parseInt('Infinity', 29) // -> 385849803
parseInt('Infinity', 30) // -> 13693557269
// ...
parseInt('Infinity', 34) // -> 28872273981
parseInt('Infinity', 35) // -> 1201203301724
parseInt('Infinity', 36) // -> 1461559270678...
parseInt('Infinity', 37) // -> NaN
```

Be careful with parsing `null` too:

```js
parseInt(null, 24) // -> 23
```

**💡 Explanation:**

> It's converting `null` to the string `"null"` and trying to convert it. For radixes 0 through 23, there are no numerals it can convert, so it returns NaN. At 24, `"n"`, the 14th letter, is added to the numeral system. At 31, `"u"`, the 21st letter, is added and the entire string can be decoded. At 37 on there is no longer any valid numeral set that can be generated and `NaN` is returned.
>
> &mdash; [“parseInt(null, 24) === 23… wait, what?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6459758/parseintnull-24-23-wait-what) at StackOverflow

Don't forget about octals:

```js
parseInt('06'); // 6
parseInt('08'); // 8 if support ECMAScript 5
parseInt('08'); // 0 if not support ECMAScript 5
```

**💡 Explanation:** If the input string begins with "0", radix is eight (octal) or 10 (decimal). Exactly which radix is chosen is implementation-dependent. ECMAScript 5 specifies that 10 (decimal) is used, but not all browsers support this yet. For this reason always specify a radix when using `parseInt`.

`parseInt` always convert input to string:

```js
parseInt({ toString: () => 2, valueOf: () => 1 }) // -> 2
Number({ toString: () => 2, valueOf: () => 1 })   // -> 1
```

## Math with `true` and `false`

Let's do some math:

```js
true + true // -> 2
(true + true) * (true + true) - true // -> 3
```

Hmmm… 🤔

### 💡 Explanation:

We can coerce values to numbers with the `Number` constructor. It's quite obvious that `true` will be coerced to `1`:

```js
Number(true) // -> 1
```


The unary plus operator attempts to convert its value into a number. It can convert string representations of integers and floats, as well as the non-string values `true`, `false`, and `null`. If it cannot parse a particular value, it will evaluate to `NaN`. That means we can coerce `true` to `1` easier:

```js
+true // -> 1
```

When you're performing addition or multiplication, the `ToNumber` method is invoked. According to the specification, this method returns:

> If `argument` is **true**, return **1**. If `argument` is **false**, return **+0**.

That's why we can add boolean values as regular numbers and get correct results.

Corresponding sections:

* [**12.5.6** Unary `+` Operator](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-unary-plus-operator)
* [**12.8.3** The Addition Operator (`+`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-addition-operator-plus)
* [**7.1.3** ToNumber(`argument`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-tonumber)

## HTML comments are valid in JavaScript

You will be impressed, but `<!--` (which is known as HTML comment) is a valid comment in JavaScript.

```js
// valid comment
<!-- valid comment too
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Impressed? HTML-like comments were intended to allow browsers that didn't understand the `<script>` tag to degrade gracefully. These browsers, e.g. Netscape 1.x are no longer popular. So there is really no point in putting HTML comments in your script tags anymore.

Since Node.js is based on the V8 engine, HTML-like comments are supported by the Node.js runtime too. Moreover, they're a part of the specification:

* [**B.1.3** HTML-like Comments](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-html-like-comments)

## `NaN` is ~~not~~ a number

Type of `NaN` is a `'number'`:

```js
typeof NaN            // -> 'number'
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Explanations of how `typeof` and `instanceof` operators work:

* [**12.5.5** The `typeof` Operator](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-typeof-operator)
* [**12.10.4** Runtime Semantics: InstanceofOperator(`O`,`C`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-instanceofoperator)

## `[]` and `null` are objects

```js
typeof []   // -> 'object'
typeof null // -> 'object'

// however
null instanceof Object // false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The behavior of `typeof` operator is defined in this section of the specification:

* [**12.5.5** The `typeof` Operator](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-typeof-operator)

According to the specification, the `typeof` operator returns a string according to [Table 35: `typeof` Operator Results](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#table-35). For `null`, ordinary, standard exotic and non-standard exotic objects, which do not implement `[[Call]]`, it returns the string `"object"`.

However, you can check the type of an object by using the `toString` method.

```js
Object.prototype.toString.call([])
// -> '[object Array]'

Object.prototype.toString.call(new Date)
// -> '[object Date]'

Object.prototype.toString.call(null)
// -> '[object Null]'
```

## Magically increasing numbers

```js
999999999999999  // -> 999999999999999
9999999999999999 // -> 10000000000000000

10000000000000000       // -> 10000000000000000
10000000000000000 + 1   // -> 10000000000000000
10000000000000000 + 1.1 // -> 10000000000000002
```

### 💡 Explanation:

This is caused by IEEE 754-2008 standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. At this scale, it rounds to the nearest even number. Read more:

* [**6.1.6** The Number Type](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type)
* [IEEE 754](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) on Wikipedia

## Precision of `0.1 + 0.2`

A well-known joke. An addition of `0.1` and `0.2` is deadly precise:

```js
0.1 + 0.2 // -> 0.30000000000000004
(0.1 + 0.2) === 0.3 // -> false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The answer for the [”Is floating point math broken?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken) question on StackOverflow:

> The constants `0.2` and `0.3` in your program will also be approximations to their true values. It happens that the closest `double` to `0.2` is larger than the rational number `0.2` but that the closest `double` to `0.3` is smaller than the rational number `0.3`. The sum of `0.1` and `0.2` winds up being larger than the rational number `0.3` and hence disagreeing with the constant in your code.

This problem is so known that there is even a website called [0.30000000000000004.com](http://0.30000000000000004.com/). It occurs in every language that uses floating-point math, not just JavaScript.

## Patching numbers

You can add your own methods to wrapper objects like `Number` or `String`.

```js
Number.prototype.isOne = function () {
  return Number(this) === 1
}

1.0.isOne() // -> true
1..isOne()  // -> true
2.0.isOne() // -> false
(7).isOne() // -> false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Obviously, you can extend `Number` object like any other object in JavaScript. However, it's not recommended if the behavior of defined method is not a part of the specification. Here is the list of `Number`'s properties:

* [**20.1** Number Objects](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-number-objects)

## Comparison of three numbers

```js
1 < 2 < 3 // -> true
3 > 2 > 1 // -> false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Why does this work that way? Well, the problem is in the first part of an expression. Here's how it works:

```js
1 < 2 < 3 // 1 < 2 -> true
true  < 3 // true -> 1
1     < 3 // -> true

3 > 2 > 1 // 3 > 2 -> true
true  > 1 // true -> 1
1     > 1 // -> false
```

We can fix this with _Greater than or equal operator (`>=`)_:

```js
3 > 2 >= 1 // true
```

Read more about Relational operators in the specification:

* [**12.10** Relational Operators](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-relational-operators)

## Funny math

Often the results of arithmetic operations in JavaScript might be quite unexpected. Consider these examples:

```js
 3  - 1  // -> 2
 3  + 1  // -> 4
'3' - 1  // -> 2
'3' + 1  // -> '31'

'' + '' // -> ''
[] + [] // -> ''
{} + [] // -> 0
[] + {} // -> '[object Object]'
{} + {} // -> '[object Object][object Object]'

'222' - -'111' // -> 333

[4] * [4]       // -> 16
[] * []         // -> 0
[4, 4] * [4, 4] // NaN
```

### 💡 Explanation:

What's happening in the first four examples? Here's a small table to understand addition in JavaScript:

```
Number  + Number  -> addition
Boolean + Number  -> addition
Boolean + Boolean -> addition
Number  + String  -> concatenation
String  + Boolean -> concatenation
String  + String  -> concatenation
```

What about other examples? A `ToPrimitive` and `ToString` methods are being implicitly called for `[]` and `{}` before addition. Read more about evaluation process in the specification:

* [**12.8.3** The Addition Operator (`+`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-addition-operator-plus)
* [**7.1.1** ToPrimitive(`input` [,`PreferredType`])](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-toprimitive)
* [**7.1.12** ToString(`argument`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-tostring)

## Addition of RegExps

Did you know you can add numbers like this?

```js
// Patch a toString method
RegExp.prototype.toString = function() {
  return this.source
}

/7/ - /5/ // -> 2
```

### 💡 Explanation:

* [**21.2.5.10** get RegExp.prototype.source](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-get-regexp.prototype.source)

## Strings aren't instances of `String`

```js
'str' // -> 'str'
typeof 'str' // -> 'string'
'str' instanceof String // -> false
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The `String` constructor returns a string:

```js
typeof String('str')   // -> 'string'
String('str')          // -> 'str'
String('str') == 'str' // -> true
```

Let's try with a `new`:

```js
new String('str') == 'str' // -> true
typeof new String('str')   // -> 'object'
```

Object? What's that?

```js
new String('str') // -> [String: 'str']
```

More information about the String constructor in the specification:

* [**21.1.1** The String Constructor](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-string-constructor)

## Calling functions with backticks

Let's declare a function which logs all params into the console:

```js
function f(...args) {
  return args
}
```

No doubt, you know you can call this function like this:

```js
f(1, 2, 3) // -> [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

But did you know you can call any function with backticks?

```js
f`true is ${true}, false is ${false}, array is ${[1,2,3]}`
// -> [ [ 'true is ', ', false is ', ', array is ', '' ],
// ->   true,
// ->   false,
// ->   [ 1, 2, 3 ] ]
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Well, this is not magic at all if you're familiar with _Tagged template literals_. In the example above, `f` function is a tag for template literal. Tags before template literal allow you to parse template literals with a function. The first argument of a tag function contains an array of string values. The remaining arguments are related to the expressions. Example:

```js
function template(strings, ...keys) {
  // do something with strings and keys…
}
```
This is the [magic behind](http://mxstbr.blog/2016/11/styled-components-magic-explained/) famous library called [💅 styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/), which is popular in the React community.

## Call call call

> Found by [@cramforce](http://twitter.com/cramforce)

```js
console.log.call.call.call.call.call.apply(a => a, [1, 2])
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Attention, it could break your mind! Try to reproduce this code in your head: we're applying the `call` method using the `apply` method. Read more:

* [**19.2.3.3** Function.prototype.call(`thisArg`, ...`args`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-function.prototype.call)
* [**19.2.3.1 ** Function.prototype.apply(`thisArg`, `argArray`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-function.prototype.apply)

## A `constructor` property

```js
const c = 'constructor'
c[c][c]('console.log("WTF?")')() // > WTF?
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Let's consider this example step-by-step:

```js
// Declare a new constant which is a string 'constructor'
const c = 'constructor'

// c is a string
c // -> 'constructor'

// Getting a constructor of string
c[c] // -> [Function: String]

// Getting a constructor of constructor
c[c][c] // -> [Function: Function]

// Call the Function constructor and pass
// the body of new function as an argument
c[c][c]('console.log("WTF?")') // -> [Function: anonymous]

// And then call this anonymous function
// The result is console-logging a string 'WTF?'
c[c][c]('console.log("WTF?")')() // > WTF?
```

An `Object.prototype.constructor` returns a reference to the `Object` constructor function that created the instance object. In case with strings it is `String`, in case with numbers it is `Number` and so on.

* [`Object.prototype.constructor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor) at MDN
* [**19.1.3.1** Object.prototype.constructor](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-object.prototype.constructor)

## Object as a key of object's property

```js
{ [{}]: {} } // -> { '[object Object]': {} }
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Why does this work so? Here we're using a _Computed property name_. When you pass an object between those brackets, it coerces object to a string, so we get the property key `'[object Object]'` and the value `{}`.

We can make "brackets hell" like this:

```js
({[{}]:{[{}]:{}}})[{}][{}] // -> {}

// structure:
// {
//   '[object Object]': {
//     '[object Object]': {}
//   }
// }
```

* [Object initializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer) at MDN
* [**12.2.6** Object Initializer](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-object-initializer)

## Accessing prototypes with `__proto__`

As we know, primitives don't have prototypes. However, if we try to get a value of `__proto__` for primitives, we would get this:

```js
(1).__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ // -> null
```

### 💡 Explanation:

This happens because when something doesn't have a prototype, it will be wrapped into a wrapper object using the `ToObject` method. So, step-by-step:

```js
(1).__proto__ // -> [Number: 0]
(1).__proto__.__proto__ // -> {}
(1).__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ // -> null
```

Here is more information about `__proto__`:

* [**B.2.2.1** Object.prototype.__proto__](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-object.prototype.__proto__)
* [**7.1.13** ToObject(`argument`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-toobject)

## ``` `${{Object}}` ```

What is the result of the expression below?

```js
`${{Object}}`
```

The answer is:

```js
// -> '[object Object]'
```

### 💡 Explanation:

We defined an object with a property `Object` using _Shorthand property notation_:

```js
{ Object: Object }
```

Then we've passed this object to the template literal, so the `toString` method calls for that object. That's why we get the string `'[object Object]'`.

* [**12.2.9** Template Literals](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-template-literals)
* [Object initializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer) at MDN

## Destructuring with default values

Consider this example:

```js
let x, { x: y = 1 } = { x }; y;
```

The example above is a great task for an interview. What the value of `y`? The answer is:

```js
// -> 1
```

### 💡 Explanation:

```js
let x, { x: y = 1 } = { x }; y;
//  ↑       ↑           ↑    ↑
//  1       3           2    4
```

With the example above:

1. We declare `x` with no value, so it's `undefined`.
2. Then we pack the value of `x` into the object property `x`.
3. Then we extract the value of `x` using destructuring and want to assign it to `y`. If the value is not defined, then we're going to use `1` as the default value.
4. Return the value of `y`.

* [Object initializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer) at MDN

## Dots and spreading

Interesting examples could be composed with spreading of arrays. Consider this:

```js
[...[...'...']].length // -> 3
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Why `3`? When we use the spread operator TODO(link to spec), the `@@iterator` method is called, and the returned iterator is used to obtain the values to be iterated. The default iterator for string spreads a string into characters. After spreading, we pack these characters into an array. Then we spread this array again and pack it back to an array.

A `'...'` string consists with three `.` characters, so the length of resulting array is `3`.

Now, step-by-step:

```js
[...'...']             // -> [ '.', '.', '.' ]
[...[...'...']]        // -> [ '.', '.', '.' ]
[...[...'...']].length // -> 3
```

Obviously, we can spread and wrap the elements of an array as many times as we want:

```js
[...'...']                 // -> [ '.', '.', '.' ]
[...[...'...']]            // -> [ '.', '.', '.' ]
[...[...[...'...']]]       // -> [ '.', '.', '.' ]
[...[...[...[...'...']]]]  // -> [ '.', '.', '.' ]
// and so on …
```

## Labels

Not so many programmers know about labels in JavaScript. They are kind of interesting:

```js
foo: {
  console.log('first');
  break foo;
  console.log('second');
}

// > first
// -> undefined
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The labeled statement is used with `break` or `continue` statements. You can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the `break` or `continue` statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.

In the example above, we identify a label `foo`. After that `console.log('first');` executes and then we interrupt the execution.

Read more about labels in JavaScript:

* [**13.13** Labelled Statements](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-labelled-statements)
* [Labeled statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label) at MDN

## Nested labels

```js
a: b: c: d: e: f: g: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; // -> 5
```

### 💡 Explanation:

Similar to previous examples, follow these links:

* [**12.16** Comma Operator (`,`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-comma-operator)
* [**13.13** Labelled Statements](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-labelled-statements)
* [Labeled statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label) at MDN

## Insidious `try..catch`

What will this expression return? `2` or `3`?

```js
(() => {
  try {
    return 2;
  } finally {
    return 3;
  }
})()
```

The answer is `3`. Surprised?

### 💡 Explanation:

* [**13.15** The `try` Statement](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-try-statement)

## Is this multiple inheritance?

Take a look at the example below:

```js
new (class F extends (String, Array) { }) // -> F []
```

Is this a multiple inheritance? Nope.

### 💡 Explanation:

The interesting part is the value of the `extends` clause (`(String, Array)`). The grouping operator always returns its last argument, so `(String, Array)` is actually just `Array`. That means we've just created a class which extends `Array`.

* [**14.5** Class Definitions](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-class-definitions)
* [**12.16** Comma Operator (`,`)](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-comma-operator)

## A generator which yields itself

Consider this example of a generator which yields itself:

```js
(function* f() { yield f })().next()
// -> { value: [GeneratorFunction: f], done: false }
```

As you can see, the returned value is an object with its `value` equal to `f`. In that case, we can do something like this:

```js
(function* f() { yield f })().next().value().next()
// -> { value: [GeneratorFunction: f], done: false }

// and again
(function* f() { yield f })().next().value().next().value().next()
// -> { value: [GeneratorFunction: f], done: false }

// and again
(function* f() { yield f })().next().value().next().value().next().value().next()
// -> { value: [GeneratorFunction: f], done: false }

// and so on
// …
```

### 💡 Explanation:

To understand why this works that way, read these sections of the specification:

* [**25** Control Abstraction Objects](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-control-abstraction-objects)
* [**25.3** Generator Objects](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-generator-objects)

## A class of class

Consider this obfuscated syntax playing:

```js
(typeof (new (class { class () {} }))) // -> 'object'
```

It seems like we're declaring a class inside of class. Should be and error, however, we get the string `'object'`.

### 💡 Explanation:

Since ECMAScript 5 era, _keywords_ are allowed as _property names_. So think about it as about this simple object example:

```js
const foo = {
  class: function() {}
};
```

And ES6 standardized shorthand method definitions. Also, classes can be anonymous. So if we drop `: function` part, we're going to get:

```js
class {
  class() {}
}
```

The result of a default class is always a simple object. And its typeof should return `'object'`.

Read more here:

* [**14.3** Method Definitions](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-method-definitions)
* [**14.5** Class Definitions](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-class-definitions)

## Non-coercible objects

With well-known symbols, there's a way to get rid of type coercion. Take a look:

```js
function nonCoercible(val) {
  if (val == null) {
    throw TypeError('nonCoercible should not be called with null or undefined')
  }

  const res = Object(val)

  res[Symbol.toPrimitive] = () => {
    throw TypeError('Trying to coerce non-coercible object')
  }

  return res
}
```

Now we can use this like this:

```js
// objects
const foo = nonCoercible({foo: 'foo'})

foo * 10      // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object
foo + 'evil'  // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object

// strings
const bar = nonCoercible('bar')

bar + '1'                 // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object
bar.toString() + 1        // -> bar1
bar === 'bar'             // -> false
bar.toString() === 'bar'  // -> true
bar == 'bar'              // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object

// numbers
const baz = nonCoercible(1)

baz == 1             // -> TypeError: Trying to coerce non-coercible object
baz === 1            // -> false
baz.valueOf() === 1  // -> true
```

## Tricky arrow functions

Consider the example below:

```js
let f = () => 10
f() // -> 10
```

Okay, fine, but what about this:

```js
let f = () => {}
f() // -> undefined
```

### 💡 Explanation:

You might expect `{}` instead of `undefined`. This is because the curly braces are part of the syntax of the arrow functions, so `f` will return undefined.

## Tricky return

`return` statement is also tricky. Consider this:

```js
(function () {
  return
  {
    b : 10
  }
})() // -> undefined
```

### 💡 Explanation:

`return` and the returned expression must be in the same line:

```js
(function () {
  return {
    b : 10
  }
})() // -> { b: 10 }
```

## Accessing object properties with arrays

```js
var obj = { property: 1 }
var array = ['property']

obj[array] // -> 1
```

What about pseudo-multidimensional arrays?

```js
var map = {}
var x = 1
var y = 2
var z = 3

map[[x, y, z]] = true
map[[x + 10, y, z]] = true

map["1,2,3"]  // -> true
map["11,2,3"] // -> true
```

### 💡 Explanation:

The brackets `[]` operator converts the expression passed `toString`. Converting an one-element array to string it's like converting the element to the string:

```js
['property'].toString() // -> 'property'
```
